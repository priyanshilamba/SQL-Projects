# Pizza-Sales--SQL

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing pizza sales data using SQL to derive meaningful business insights. The SQL file contains queries designed to answer specific analytical questions related to sales, customer behavior, and business performance. Each question is included as a comment in the SQL file, followed by the corresponding SQL query.
## Contents
Pizza Sales SQL Project.sql: Contains SQL queries along with commented-out questions for reference.
## Technologies Used
- SQL (Structured Query Language)

- Database Compatibility: MySQL, or SQL Server 

- SQL Execution Tools: MySQL Workbench
## How to Use
- Setup the Database: Ensure that you have a SQL database containing the pizza sales dataset. If not available, import a dataset that fits the queries.

- Load the SQL File: Open Pizza Sales SQL Project.sql in your preferred SQL editor.

- Understand the Queries: Read through the commented questions before executing the SQL queries.

- Run the Queries: Execute each query in sequence to retrieve insights.

- Analyze the Results: Use the output to draw business conclusions and recommendations.
## Questions Answered
The project addresses several analytical queries, including but not limited to:

- Sales Performance Analysis:

What is the total revenue generated from pizza sales?

What are the best-selling and least-selling pizzas?

- Customer Behavior Insights:

What is the average order value?

What is the average number of pizzas per order?

What are the peak hours and days for sales?

- Operational Insights:

Which pizza category generates the highest revenue?

What percentage of total sales comes from each pizza type?

How does order volume vary over different time periods?
## Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:

- A structured SQL database containing pizza sales data.

- A SQL execution environment such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.

- Basic knowledge of SQL querying and database management.
## Future Improvements
- Query Optimization: Improve execution performance by using indexes, joins, and better query structuring.

- Visualization: Use tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) to create visual reports.

- Integration: Combine sales data with customer demographics for more in-depth analysis.

- Automation: Implement stored procedures or scripts to automate report generation.
